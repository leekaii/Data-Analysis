# Exploratory Data Analysis
These are a few EDAs and Machine Learning Algorithms that I had performed and learned during my internship at Feynn Labs,

EV User Reviews:
I had performed EDA on a Electric Vehicle User's Ratings Datasets to understand how much potential does the Electric Vehicles have in the future of the world.
This was my contribution to the project team, where I was appointed as the Team Lead, responsible for assigning datasets to my teammates and do the overall documenation of the project. 
This was done using K-Means Clustering algorithm.

McDonald's Case Study:
Here, we were asked to convert a full-fledged case study on McDonald's dataset from R to Python.
Thid truly helped me to understand how python works andit's features in visulization of Data.

Demand Forecasting:
Here, I refer a Kaggle code and the coresponding dataset to deepe my understanding of Exponential Smoothening Algorithm Holt-Winter.
This was performed using both K-Means Clustering and the Holt-Winter algorithm to predict the future sales of a product.
